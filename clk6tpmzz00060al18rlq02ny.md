[Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oracle/) is currently offering free certifications for its programs until August 31, 2023. This initiative provides a valuable opportunity for professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge including utilizing [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oracle/)'s ERP system. I took advantage of this offer and obtained expertise in [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oracle/)'s ERP through self-paced training and hands-on experience. By leveraging these resources, I gained proficiency in navigating the [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oracle/) ERP system, performing tasks such as data entry, report generation, and system configuration. This experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in effectively utilizing [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oracle/)'s ERP software, making me well-prepared to contribute to the compliance and risk management efforts within the [Oracle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oracle/) ERP instances.
