**üìñ Reflections and Next Steps:** In the last week, I immersed myself in Whizlabs' Microsoft Azure Security Technologies (AZ-500) course, covering critical areas such as identities and application access, network and host security, and Azure Resource Management security. Special thanks to Victor Monga for insightful project management guidance and Emin√© Olausson Fourounjieva for emphasizing the importance of soft skills in our careers.

This week, I'm super excited to add a new layer to my expertise by diving into cloud security engineering. üõ°Ô∏è Exploring AWS, Azure, and GCP, and understanding key concepts like #OWASPTop10 has been enlightening. As a Cloud Security Engineer, I'm eager to implement robust security measures, and I'll be sharing the details soon.

Stay tuned for a comprehensive blog post with detailed insights and experiences! üìñ
